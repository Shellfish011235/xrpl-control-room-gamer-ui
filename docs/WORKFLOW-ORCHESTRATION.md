# Workflow Orchestration, Task Management & Core Principles

Best practices for structured planning, execution, and self-improvement — for AI agents (e.g. OpenClaw Builder Agent) and developers.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default

- Enter **plan mode** for any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions).
- If issues arise: **STOP and re-plan** — don’t push through.
- Use planning for **verification steps** as well as building.
- Write **detailed specs upfront** to reduce ambiguity.

### 2. Subagent Strategy

- Use **subagents liberally** to keep the main context window clean.
- Offload **research, exploration, and parallel analysis** to subagents.
- For complex problems, dedicate **more compute via subagents**.
- Each subagent: **one tack** for focused execution.

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After **any correction from the user**, update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern.
- Write **rules for yourself** that prevent the same mistake.
- **Ruthlessly iterate** on lessons until mistake rate drops.
- At session start, **review lessons** for the relevant project.

### 4. Verification Before Done

- **Never mark a task complete** without proving it works.
- When relevant, **diff behavior** between main and your changes.
- Ask: **“Would a staff engineer approve this?”**
- **Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness.**

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes, pause: **“Is there a more elegant way?”**
- If a fix feels **hacky**: “Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution.”
- For **simple, obvious fixes**: skip this; don’t over-engineer.
- **Challenge your own work** before presenting it.

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- For bug reports: **just fix it.** Don’t ask for hand-holding.
- **Point at logs, errors, failing tests** — then resolve them.
- **Zero context switching** required from the user.
- **Go fix failing CI tests** without being told how.

## Task Management

1. **Plan First** — Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items.
2. **Verify Plan** — Check in before starting implementation.
3. **Track Progress** — Mark items complete as you go.
4. **Explain Changes** — High-level summary at each step.
5. **Document Results** — Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`.
6. **Capture Lessons** — Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First** — Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness** — Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact** — Changes should only touch what’s necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
